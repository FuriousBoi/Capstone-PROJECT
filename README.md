# My First HTML Project with Multiple Web Pages

Welcome to my first HTML project! This project showcases the creation of a simple website with multiple web pages using HTML.

## Overview

This project is a part of my learning journey in web development. It includes:

- An index.html file serving as the main page.
- Additional HTML files for different sections such as "Hobbies" and "Contact."

Feel free to explore the project to understand how multiple web pages are linked in a website.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main landing page.
- `hobbies.html`: Page showcasing my hobbies.
- `contact.html`: Page with my contact details.
